# Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript

### This book assumes that you have a basic understanding of HTML and can at least put
together a simple, static website but does not assume that you have any prior knowl‐
edge of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML5—although if you do, your progress
through the book will be even quicker.
